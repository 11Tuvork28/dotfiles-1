[[https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/works-on-my-machine.svg]]

A set of my GNU/Linux configuration files. [[https://github.com/SqrtMinusOne/dotfiles][View at GitHub]].

The majority of the software is configured with [[https://leanpub.com/lit-config/read][literate configuration]] strategy via Emacs' Org Mode. This way has its advantages and disadvantages, but overall it's pretty nice to keep the configs interweaved with comments in a handful of files.

The files themselves are managed and deployed via [[https://yadm.io/][yadm]], but I mostly use Org Mode rich noweb whenever I can instead of what yadm offers.

My current GNU/Linux distribution is [[https://guix.gnu.org/][GNU Guix]]. In the context of this repo, Guix allows me to list all the used programs in manifests, which means I have the same set of programs across multiple machines. Look for tables with "Guix dependency" in the header.
